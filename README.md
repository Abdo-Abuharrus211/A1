This project is a web application that demonstrates the use of cookies, sessions, EJS templating, and routes using Node.js and Express framework.

To use this application, first, clone the repository to your local machine, and then run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.

The application includes the following files and folders:

1. `app.js`: This is the main file that contains the setup for the Express application, middleware, routes, and other configurations.

2. `views` folder: This folder contains all the EJS templates used in the application.

3. `public` folder: This folder contains all the static files such as images, CSS, and JavaScript files.

4. `routes` folder: This folder contains all the route files used in the application.

5. `controllers` folder: This folder contains all the controller files used in the application.

6. `models` folder: This folder contains all the database model files used in the application.

7. `middlewares` folder: This folder contains all the middleware functions used in the application.

The application uses cookies and sessions to keep track of user login status and other user-specific data. The EJS templating engine is used to render dynamic HTML pages based on user requests, and routes are used to define the application endpoints and handle HTTP requests.

To run the application, use the command `npm start` in the terminal, and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

This project serves as a foundation for building more complex web applications using Node.js and Express framework, incorporating cookies, sessions, EJS templating, and routes.
